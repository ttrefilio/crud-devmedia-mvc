DevMedia

This is a small costumer registration system developed to be presented during the interview of DevMedia (which was my last workplace).
It was developed by using C#, Asp.NET MVC, Bootstrap, EntityFramework and performs operations on the database such as CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE.

Obs: The system is in Portuguese.
